# World Wide Pizza

This web application is aimed at showing the user pizza from all over the world. With just the click of the button, they get a beautiful picture of pizza.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web application features integration with a web API that can respond to server requests with a picture of pizza from its database. The front-end features a simple click event listener, which sends a request to the web API's server, awaits the response with the image data, and inserts that image into the DOM. 

## Optimizations

This project could be improved by refactoring it into a full-stack application, which would give me more control over how the requests are handled. Running this website as a full-stack app would allow me to more easily add support for form submission, as it currently only works on-click of the submission button. Additionally, I'd love to get more specific with which pizza pictures are retrieved, or perhaps include fancy pizzas with a recipe for how to make them. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project was one of my first attempts at web API integration. This specific web API handles requests a little differently from the other APIs I've integrated with, so it was an interestng process to determine how to send and recieve data the correct way.
